      Hello, my name is Sofi Davalos. I am from Monterrey, Mexico and a freshman at West Texas
      A&M University.
      I am currently majoring in International Business.
    </p>

    <p>
        The reason I chose International Business is because I love traveling and I am also intersted in
        learning more about the business world. I hope to be able to travel to many places while I am in
        college as well as out of college.
    </p>

    <p id="id3">
        I am not entirely sure on my dream job yet. I am just starting out college and trying to
        figure everything
        out, but one that stands out to me is being an International Marketing Manager. Like
        I mentioned before I
        love to travel to different countries and this job involves global travel.
