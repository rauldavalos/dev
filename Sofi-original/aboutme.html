<span><b>Hello, my name is Sofi Davalos. I am from Monterrey, Mexico and a freshman at West Texas A&M University. I am currently majoring in International Business.
    <div></div><span><b>
The reason I chose International Business is because I love traveling and I am also intersted in learning more about the business world. I hope to be able to travel to many places while I am in college as well as out of college.
    <div></div>
I am not entirely sure on my dream job yet. I am just starting out college and trying to figure everything out, but one that stands out to me is being an International Marketing Manager. Like I mentioned before I love to travel to different countries and this job involves global travel.</span></span></b></p></b>
